+ Hello everyone!
+ I am very glad that I joined this course. It is very important for my future work in Germany. Every vacancy that matches my experience and level of qualification requires at least basic programming skills. That's why I am here. Before that, I worked with a computer as a regular user. The main programs that I use in my work are: Word, Excel, PowerPoint. Now it is not enough for me and I want to gain new knowledge.
+ See you on Saturday!
